#Lava Engine
## Easy, light, 2D Web-Game Engine using JavaScript and Canvas
## For teaching and learning JS and game-dev: Lava Engine's goal is give programmers the skills and confidence to write (and understand) as much of their project as possible.

## Work-In-Progress
Hi this is Will,
Lava has just finished pre-production and will soon be ready for open-source development and usage by students and teachers of all ages and experience levels.
I've built this engine around the lessons I’ve learned from running beginner programming classes for high school students and my experiences breaking into web development from a data science background. If you have any questions or issues about Lava (or if you’re running a coding class and want someone to talk to about it) email me at hello@wllm.info

## FAQ
A multitude of choice is sometimes a bad thing and when trying to get started on a web or game project this is very much the case. "It depends" can be a very deflating answer when you have a great idea and you want to get started ASAP! Here are some common questions and their answers.

### I have no coding experience, Should I start with Lava/JS/Canvas?
Yes! Usually, the hardest part of starting to program (especially for the web) is project management stuff and not learning to code. Those challenges only stress out new coders, so we provide you ALL the info you need to just focus on learning the important stuff. Getting Started section

### I have some coding experience but no JS or Web Dev experience, Should I start with Lava/JS/Canvas
Yes! Because JS programming has changed a lot over the last twenty years, getting good (and relevant) information for your needs can be very tricky! Lava uses modern Javascript and teaches you how to do the same, while introducing you to the world of web development and the meaning of concepts such as modules, typescript, node.js, development servers etc!

### I'm an amazing web developer and game developer already, What about me?
Yes, also you! Lava is 100% vanilla Javascript, you can dig through the code to check out implementations or even extend the engine! You'll find pretty quickly that Lava is doing nothing that you couldn't do yourself, which is awesome. After that, you can keep using the engine for convenience, or challenge yourself to build it all from the ground up!
